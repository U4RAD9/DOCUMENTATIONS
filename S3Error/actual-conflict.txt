# This is the current work or configuration which i can do to solve the s3 error : - Himanshu.
==================================================================================================
I guess i have to try the composite storage approach in the s3 configuration :
i.e. allowing postgres and s3 in a combined way, it needs some specific delecate precised configurations.
Currently, both the plugins (postgres and s3) are contradicting for the storage somehow, although i have put "EnableStorage = false", in the postgres config, it is still using or creating a storage area and conflicting the s3 too, and then it is taking the fallback as local storage area which i have configured using "Storage Directory" , so i can try to disable this local storage also.

--------------------
The logs you provided show an interaction between Orthanc (a DICOM server) and AWS S3 storage via the AWS SDK, but the issue of images not being stored in S3 is indicated by an exception and warnings about plugin conflicts. Let's break down the workflow and identify possible reasons for this issue.

Step-by-Step Workflow Breakdown
Initialization of AWS S3 Storage Plugin:

The logs show that the AWS S3 Storage Plugin is being initialized successfully. The log entries indicate that the plugin is trying to establish a connection with the AWS EC2 metadata service to retrieve instance credentials.
The metadata service requests various resources from the EC2 metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254), such as the token for secure access, IAM role credentials, and availability zone. This is typical when running on an EC2 instance with an IAM role attached to it.

Eventually, the correct region (ap-south-1) is detected and used for AWS S3 operations.
Plugin Conflict and Custom Storage Area Registration:

A critical error occurs later in the logs:

E1107 12:32:58.788358             MAIN PluginsManager.cpp:201] Exception while invoking plugin service 1016: Another plugin has already registered a custom storage area
This error means that another plugin has already registered a custom storage area, preventing the AWS S3 storage plugin from doing so. This is a plugin conflict, and this is likely the main reason why images are not being stored on S3.

It seems that there is also another plugin, the PostgreSQL storage plugin, that is attempting to register a custom storage area as well. The logs show that the plugin is being loaded:

The PostgreSQL plugin is disabled in the configuration file, but it's still attempting to register a storage area, which is conflicting with the S3 storage plugin.

S3 Storage Initialization:

Despite the conflict, the S3 storage plugin finishes initialization:
ruby
Copy code

Client-Side Encryption Warning:

There's a warning that client-side encryption is disabled for the S3 plugin:
ruby
Copy code
W1107 12:32:58.786620             MAIN AWS S3 Storage:/StoragePlugin.cpp:703] AWS S3 Storage: client-side encryption is disabled
This is not likely the root cause of the issue, but it’s worth noting that if encryption is required, this should be enabled.

Outcome of Plugin Conflict:

Because two plugins (PostgreSQL and AWS S3) are attempting to register custom storage areas, the S3 plugin fails to perform its intended task. This is likely why images are not being stored in S3.
Why Are Images Not Being Stored on S3?
From the logs, the root cause appears to be plugin conflict. Specifically:

Plugin Conflict: The logs show that the PostgreSQL storage plugin is trying to register its own storage area, which is blocking the S3 plugin from doing so. This issue is triggered when multiple plugins try to manage the same storage space. The error:

php
Copy code
Exception while invoking plugin service 1016: Another plugin has already registered a custom storage area
This means that the S3 plugin's custom storage registration is being overridden or denied due to this conflict.

PostgreSQL Plugin Disabled But Still Active: Even though the PostgreSQL plugin is disabled in the configuration, it still seems to be loaded and trying to register its storage area. This could indicate an issue with the configuration or a residual effect from a prior configuration change that wasn't fully cleared.

Possible Solutions
Ensure Proper Plugin Configuration:

Double-check the Orthanc configuration file to ensure that only one plugin is attempting to register a custom storage area.
If you do not require PostgreSQL storage, ensure it is disabled properly in the configuration:
ini
Copy code
[PostgreSQL]
EnableStorage = false
Ensure no conflicting configurations for custom storage areas. Only the AWS S3 plugin should be trying to register the storage area.
Disable Unnecessary Plugins:

If PostgreSQL is not required, disable or remove the PostgreSQL plugin entirely. This can be done either by disabling the plugin in the Orthanc configuration or by removing the plugin files if they are not needed.
For the AWS S3 plugin, ensure that it’s enabled correctly in the configuration and that no other plugin is conflicting with it.
Revalidate S3 Configuration:

Verify that the AWS S3 plugin has the correct configuration for accessing S3 storage, such as region, bucket name, access credentials, etc.
Ensure that the IAM role (if running on EC2) has the necessary permissions to interact with the S3 bucket (e.g., s3:PutObject, s3:GetObject, s3:ListBucket).
Restart Orthanc:

After ensuring that only the S3 plugin is active and no conflicts remain, restart Orthanc to clear any loaded state and reinitialize the plugins.
Check Plugin Dependencies:

Ensure the correct versions of the plugins are installed and compatible with your version of Orthanc.
By resolving the plugin conflict, the AWS S3 plugin should be able to register the custom storage area and successfully store images in S3 as intended.



You said:
so , the postgres and s3 , both can't work together, how is it possible, 
for storage, the metadata should be added in the postgres db and the images should be stored in s3 storage area.

Yes, you're correct—both PostgreSQL and S3 storage can work together in an Orthanc configuration, but it requires proper configuration and careful handling to avoid conflicts.

The basic idea is that:

PostgreSQL is used to store the metadata of the DICOM images (patient information, study details, etc.).
S3 is used to store the actual image files (the DICOM image data itself).
Orthanc supports this workflow by using multiple storage plugins in tandem. However, the configuration needs to be done carefully to ensure that both systems work together without conflicts. Here's how you can configure Orthanc to store metadata in PostgreSQL and image data in S3:

Steps for Configuring Orthanc with PostgreSQL and S3:
Configure PostgreSQL for Metadata Storage:

PostgreSQL should be configured to store metadata like patient info, study, series, and instance details.
In the Orthanc configuration file (Orthanc.json), you would enable PostgreSQL storage by setting EnableStorage to true under the PostgreSQL section.
You will also need to provide PostgreSQL connection details (Host, Port, User, Password, and Database).
Example:

json
Copy code
"PostgreSQL" : {
    "EnableStorage" : true,
    "Host" : "127.0.0.1",
    "Port" : 5432,
    "User" : "orthanc_user",
    "Password" : "orthanc_password",
    "Database" : "orthanc_db"
}
Configure S3 for Image Storage:

S3 is configured to store the actual image files (the binary DICOM data).
In the Orthanc configuration file, you need to enable the AWS S3 storage plugin.
You must specify the S3 bucket name, region, and AWS credentials (either via IAM roles or access keys).
Additionally, you'll need to specify whether client-side encryption is enabled (or disabled, based on your needs).
Example:

json
Copy code
"AWS S3 Storage" : {
    "EnableStorage" : true,
    "Bucket" : "your-s3-bucket-name",
    "Region" : "us-west-2",
    "AccessKey" : "your-access-key",
    "SecretKey" : "your-secret-key",
    "ClientSideEncryption" : false,
    "ServerSideEncryption" : "AES256"
}
Set Up Storage Strategy:

Orthanc supports different strategies to store data, including the Composite Storage Strategy where metadata is stored in PostgreSQL and the image data is stored in another location (e.g., S3).
This requires the CompositeStorage plugin to be configured to direct the image files to S3 while metadata goes to PostgreSQL.
Example of Orthanc.json configuration:

json
Copy code
"Storage" : {
    "EnableStorage" : true,
    "Type" : "Composite",
    "StorageAreas" : [
        "PostgreSQL",  // For metadata storage
        "S3"           // For image data storage
    ]
}
Handling Conflict with Custom Storage Areas:

It appears you are running into the error "Another plugin has already registered a custom storage area". This happens because Orthanc is trying to register a custom storage area twice.
You must ensure that only one custom storage plugin is used for custom storage areas, and the plugins should be properly coordinated.
To fix this, ensure that you disable the conflicting plugin or configure it in such a way that only one plugin manages the custom storage. If you're using PostgreSQL for metadata and S3 for images, there should be no conflict if configured as described above.

Why the Images Are Not Getting Stored in S3:
From the log and configuration details, there are a few potential reasons why the images may not be stored in S3:

S3 Plugin Configuration:

Double-check if the S3 plugin is properly enabled and configured. The log message "AWS S3 Storage: client-side encryption is disabled" suggests that the S3 plugin is working, but make sure all other required fields (such as Bucket, Region, and AWS credentials) are correctly specified.
The configuration may be missing, incomplete, or incorrect, which would prevent the images from being sent to S3.
PostgreSQL Plugin Conflict:

The error Another plugin has already registered a custom storage area indicates that a conflict exists between the plugins. Orthanc only allows one custom storage plugin to register a custom storage area, so you need to ensure that PostgreSQL and S3 are not trying to register custom storage areas at the same time.
If both plugins are attempting to register custom storage areas simultaneously, Orthanc will fail to initialize the storage correctly.
Ensure that PostgreSQL is set only to handle metadata and that S3 is set to handle image storage.
Composite Storage Plugin Issue:

The CompositeStorage plugin may not be enabled or correctly configured. This plugin is needed to split the storage responsibilities, where metadata is stored in PostgreSQL and the actual image data in S3.
Verify the configuration for the Storage section in Orthanc.json to ensure that the composite storage strategy is set up properly.
Permissions and Authentication:

Verify that the AWS credentials provided to the S3 plugin are correct and have sufficient permissions to store files in the specified S3 bucket. This includes checking the IAM role (if using EC2) or the access/secret key permissions.
Also, verify if the AWS region matches the S3 bucket's region. Mismatched regions could cause connection issues.
Server Logs:

Check Orthanc's logs carefully for any other error or warning messages related to S3 storage. These can provide more specific details about the issue.
Final Checklist:
PostgreSQL: Ensure that metadata storage in PostgreSQL is correctly configured with EnableStorage: true and database credentials.
S3: Ensure that the S3 plugin is enabled with the correct credentials, bucket name, and region.
Composite Storage: Make sure the CompositeStorage plugin is used to configure PostgreSQL for metadata and S3 for images.
Avoid Conflicts: Ensure that no two plugins are registering custom storage areas.
Permissions: Verify AWS permissions for S3 storage and IAM roles if necessary.
Review Logs: Continuously monitor the logs for any specific errors related to the configuration or plugin initialization.
By following these steps, Orthanc can be configured to store metadata in PostgreSQL and image files in S3 without conflicts.
